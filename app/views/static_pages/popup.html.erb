	        <p>Public engagement is a big part of what we at IAR are about, it is a great way of letting people know about the archaeology in their immediate surroundings as well as informing them on the archaeology, monument and history of Northern Ireland and on the isle as a whole and how our story fits into the wider global view.</p>

	        <h3>Innovation</h3>
			<p>We have launched an innovative, hands-on, heritage scheme called The Pop-Up Museum. The pop-up museum will display the artefacts found during archaeological investigations around the country and enable people to interact with them, the pop-up museum it can be housed indoors or outdoors in its own marquee.</p>

			<p>Public engagement is a great way of getting your theme or topic across to the public. We can and have taken part in numerous public engagement events for festivals, councils, local monuments, community groups, schools and commercial companies. If you would like a fun, colourful, unique and educational addition to your event please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> for a quote, we can tailor the museum to suit your event or theme.</p>
