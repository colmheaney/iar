      		<p>We work with primary and post primary schools, after schools programmes, holiday schemes and community groups. We have developed a series of archaeology talks and workshops that complement and integrate with the teaching curriculum in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Our workshops incorporate visual presentations, excavations, surveys and hands-on interaction with genuine and replica artefacts and assessing the lives of ancient people through careful examination of the material they left behind. Our educational programme guides, motivates and encourage children to draw together diverse threads of evidence in order to give relevance to everyday objects, places and landscapes.</p>
